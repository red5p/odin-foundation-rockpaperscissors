### Things need to be improved next time:
* Make javascript code less messy(use global variable?).
* Give variables more meaningful names(header, main, footer, etc.).
* Separate functionalities into different functions.
* Use class and id in a better way.
* And consider difference between browsers default styles. Add reset stylesheet next time?
